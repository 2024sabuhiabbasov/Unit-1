# Quiz 008
**Statement**

I can't include the statement in my file, because the Quiz 008 is not in the learning log yet.

## My solutions
### Code
```.py
roomNum = int(input("Please input the room number to see its floor and room number: "))

f = roomNum // 10 + 1
num = roomNum % 10

if f == 11:
    f = 10
if num == 0:
    num = 10

print(str(f) + "F" + str(num))
```

**Testing the code**
