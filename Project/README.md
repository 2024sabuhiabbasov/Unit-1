# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a CryptoWallet for a client who is a local trader in Japan. The CryptoWallet will be about ———— and is constructed using the software Python. It will take  1 month to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A.

I am going to use the cryptocurrency named **BNB**. BNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance chain. Its uses have expanded to numerous applications on a wide number of platforms. It is used to pay for transaction fees on Binance.com, Binance DEX, and Binance Chain.

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger shows the values of datas in 3 currencies: US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen. 
5. The application is protected with authentication questions.
6. The electronic ledger can categorize transactions done by the user. For example, how much crypto money spent on daily products.

# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram

The program will be based on Windows 10 with AMD Ryzen 3 3250U processor with 8 GB of RAM. The program will be written in the Python language. I will use PyCharm 2022.1.3 version to implement my ideas to code. There will be reading and writing operations between database.csv and CryptoWallet.py file. My program will get input by using the keyboard and print the output by using the monitor.
