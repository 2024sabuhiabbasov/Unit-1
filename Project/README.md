# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a program for a client who is a local trader in Japan. The program will about ———— and is constructed using the software Python. It will take  1 month to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A.

I am going to use the cryptocurrency named **BNB**. BNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance chain. Its uses have expanded to numerous applications on a wide number of platforms. It is used to pay for transaction fees on Binance.com, Binance DEX, and Binance Chain.
