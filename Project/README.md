# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized.

Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a CryptoWallet for a client who is a local trader in Japan. The CryptoWallet will be about ———— and is constructed using the software Python. It will take  1 month to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A.

I am going to use the cryptocurrency named **BNB**. BNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance chain. Its uses have expanded to numerous applications on a wide number of platforms. It is used to pay for transaction fees on Binance.com, Binance DEX, and Binance Chain.
