2. Variables are used to distinguish between variables of different types. For example, we have integer, double, string, char, etc. In the Python programming language, we will come across variables such as integer and string. <br />
3. CTS defines how variables are declared and used. It supports two general categories: <br/>
   1. Value types (values that are declared by us to one variable)
   2. Rference types (arrays, class, etc.)
