How many USB memories of 4Gb would be required to download the memories of an adult?

The average adult human brain has the ability to store the equivalent of 2.5 million gigabytes digital memory. So if we devide 2.5 million gigabytes by 4 gigabytes, we get 625000 which means we need 625000 USB memories of 4Gb.

Thanks for reviewing!
