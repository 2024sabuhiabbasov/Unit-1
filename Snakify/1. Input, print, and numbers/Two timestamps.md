# Two timestamps
### Statement
A timestamp is three numbers: a number of hours, minutes and seconds. Given two timestamps, calculate how many seconds is between them. The moment of the first timestamp occurred before the moment of the second timestamp.
### My code
```.py
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
a1 = int(input())
b1 = int(input())
c1 = int(input())
h = (a1 - a) * 60 * 60
m = (b1 - b) * 60
s = (c1 - c)
print(h + m + s)
```
### The result
