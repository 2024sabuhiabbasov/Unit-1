# Previous and next
### Statement
Write a program that reads an integer number and prints its previous and next numbers. See the examples below for the exact format your answers should take. There shouldn't be a space before the period.

Remember that you can convert the numbers to strings using the function str.
### My code
```.py
a = int(input())
print('The next number for the number ' + str(a) +  ' is ' + str(a + 1) + '.')
print('The previous number for the number ' + str(a) +  ' is ' + str(a - 1) + '.')
```
### The result
